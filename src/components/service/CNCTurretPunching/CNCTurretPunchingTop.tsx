        <h3>CNC Turret Punching</h3>
        <p>
          Punching , or die-cutting, is a sheet metal forming method, which is
          used if metal sheet or plate parts have to be made with recurring
          recesses, cutouts, louvers or beads. If all the elements to be formed
          are the same, punching is superior to other cutting methods, such as
          laser cutting, in terms of production speed. Punching technology,
          still very much a modern technique, has sometimes been overshadowed by
          laser cutting. However, with modern automation techniques and enormous
          processing speeds, punching machines are often the far cheaper
          alternative to laser cutting.
