        <h3>Design and Product Development</h3>
        <p>
          During personal meetings with our customers, our experienced designers
          find the ideal solutions for implementing sheet metal designs. We work
          with customers on their exact needs for enclosures / chassis, panels,
          brackets, precision components, tight-tolerance machined parts and
          complex welded components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using state-of-the-art 3D design programs, we create the computer
          models which allow our customers to thoroughly test their products
          before manufacturing. After customer approval, the first prototypes
          are produced, which then forms the basis for later manufacturing.
