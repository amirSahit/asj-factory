      <h3>Forming and Bending</h3>
      <p>
        After cutting is often the forming of the parts as needed. Forming can
        be used in metalworking to bend, roll, and shape pieces to reach their
        desired form.Also in this field of sheet metal fabrication., we offer
        the highest level of expertise and technology. With a hydraulic CNC
        press brake and built-in angle measuring systems and constant bending
        force distribution, we achieve perfect results from the first part. This
        avoids unnecessary scrap and sample parts and offers our customers a
        noteworthy price advantage.
