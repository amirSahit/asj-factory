      <p>
        After fabrication, in which individual parts and steps were manufactured
        per your needs, the final step is assembly of these carefully processed
        components. We assemble, adjust, and check the product after assembly to
        assure functionality. Each device leaves the company only after an
        in-depth functional test and report. ASJ fabricates and assembles
        various types of sheet metal assemblies for the electronics, medical,
        lighting, dental, audio and consumer industries as well as other
        industries that require custom assemblies.
