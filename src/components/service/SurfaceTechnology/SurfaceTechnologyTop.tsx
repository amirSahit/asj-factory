      <h3>Surface Technology</h3>
      <p>
        Surface technology in the context of metal sheet fabrication refers to
        the various processes and techniques used to modify and enhance the
        surface properties of metal sheets. These processes are aimed at
        improving the functionality, durability, appearance, and performance of
        the metal sheets.

      <p>We offer the following surface treatment techniques:</p>
      <ul className="pl-4">
        <li>
          • Grinding of laser, punched and formed parts with your desired grain
        </li>
        <li>• Uniform edge rounding</li>
        <li>• Deburring of workpieces</li>
        <li>• Brush optics</li>
        <li>• Polishing</li>
      </ul>
