      <p>
        Parts, cut from sheet metal are often not yet completed according to
        today's requirements with the cutting process. Burr-freedom, in order to
        prevent injuries and to ensure paints of the necessary quality in
        connection with a perfect surface are increasingly far-reaching
        requirements. Generally speaking, it's unwanted material that can be
        fixed by hand, tumbling, vibratory deburring and abrasive blasting or
        grinding.
