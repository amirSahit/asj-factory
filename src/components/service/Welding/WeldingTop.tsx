      <h3>Metal Welding</h3>
      <p>
        Welding is a process in fabrication that conjoins materials, usually
        metals, via coalescence. It mildly melts the parts that are being welded
        and adds filler which turns to molten material to forma bond between the
        parts. It doesn’t matter whether WIG, MT, MAG, stud welding, point
        welding, we can offer the optimum welding process for your component in
        all materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our welding table, which is equipped with a 3D clamping system, we
        are able to manufacture the most complex welding groups at the highest
        precision and quality in our workspaces.
      </p>
