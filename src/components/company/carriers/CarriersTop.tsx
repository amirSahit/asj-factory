      <h3>Your career with ASJ</h3>
      <p>
        The greatest capital our company has is our employees. Even the largest
        and most modern machine has no value if it is not operated correctly.
        This is why we are always looking for new employees, who fit into our
        team like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Outstandingly well trained
        coworkers in combination with modern CNC machines form the foundation
        for our success.
