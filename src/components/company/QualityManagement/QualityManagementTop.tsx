      <h3>Quality Assurance</h3>
      <p>
        Quality Assurance (QA) prevents mistakes and defects in manufactured
        products when delivering products to our customers. We apply QA
        processes to physical products in pre-production in order to verify the
        final product will meet all specification. We believe our customers know
        their products and needs best. Therefore, we work at partnering with our
        customers to achieve the best products and solutions. Our goal is not
        only to meet expectations, but to exceed them.
