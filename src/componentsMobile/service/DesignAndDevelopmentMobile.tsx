        During personal meetings with our customers, our experienced designers
        find the ideal solutions for implementing sheet metal designs. We work
        with customers on their exact needs for enclosures / chassis, panels,
        brackets, precision components, tight-tolerance machined parts and
        complex welded components.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of Product Design </h2>
      <p>We create prototypes and production design in:</p>
      <ul className="pl-2">
        <li>• Sheet metal</li>
        <li>• Welded components</li>
        <li>• Mechanical assembly</li>
        <li>• Precision parts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using state-of-the-art 3D design programs, we create the computer models
        which allow our customers to thoroughly test their products before
        manufacturing. After customer approval, the first prototypes are
        produced, which then forms the basis for later manufacturing.
